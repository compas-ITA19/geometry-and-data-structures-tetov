# Assignment module0, 02_geometry_and_datastructures

See `assignment.py`.

**Note**: My own goal was to write as many of the functions myself, to not rely on COMPAS too much. COMPAS was only used for the datastructures task. Here's the imports:

```python
from math import sqrt
from typing import List, Iterator

import numpy as np

from compas import get
from compas.datastructures import Mesh
from compas_plotters import MeshPlotter

import doctest
```
